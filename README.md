# WasteWizard

Welcome to WasteWizard, a fun and educational app that challenges you to sort different types of trash into the appropriate categories. This app features a mini game where you can drag different types of trash using draggable objects that track the coordinates of the items you move. It also includes a trivia section that teaches you about the different colors of trash bins and what they represent.

## Mini Game

The mini game in this app is a fun and interactive way to learn about waste management and environmental sustainability. The game challenges you to sort different types of trash into the appropriate categories, using draggable objects that track the coordinates of the items you move. The game provides instant feedback on whether you correctly sorted the items into the appropriate categories.

## Trivia

In addition to the mini game, this app also includes a trivia section that teaches you about the different colors of trash bins and what they represent. The trivia section uses a carousel to display multiple-choice questions, and a tab view to organize different topics related to trash and recycling. This feature enables you to navigate through different questions and provides a dynamic and engaging way to learn about different aspects of waste management.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, simply clone the repository and open the project in Xcode. The app is built using Swift and requires a minimum deployment target of iOS 16.0. This app was built by using iPad Pro 12.9 inch (6th Generation) simulator, I recommend you to use the same simulator for the best experience.
